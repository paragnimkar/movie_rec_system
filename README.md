# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a selected title, using cosine similarity.

**Overview**

This project leverages a content-based filtering technique to recommend movies based on their features. The recommendation system calculates the cosine similarity between movies, allowing users to explore and discover movies similar to those they already enjoy.

**Features**

**Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similarity in features such as genre, cast, director, and keywords.
**Cosine Similarity**: Computes similarity scores to identify and suggest movies closely related to a selected title.
**User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing a straightforward and interactive experience.

**How It Works**

**Data Preparation**: Movie data is preprocessed to extract features.
**Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity measures are used to find movies similar to the user-selected movie.
**Recommendations**: The system suggests five movies that are closest in similarity to the selected movie.
